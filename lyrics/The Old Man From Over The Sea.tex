\textit{Ay, but I'll not have him.}
There was an old man came over the sea,
Came snivelling, snuffling, over on me.}

A‚Äêshivering and shaking.}

\textit{Ay, but I'll not have him.}
My mother she told me to bid him come in,
And he giggled and dribbled all over his chin.}

\textit{Ay, but I'll not have him.}
My mother she told me to give him a stool,
Well I gave him a stool and he sat like a fool.}

\verse{My mother she told me to give him some cake,
\textit{Ay, but I'll not have him.}
My mother she told me to give him some cake,
And he wriggled and giggled just like a snake.}

\verse{My mother she told me to pass him the sugar,
\textit{Ay, but I'll not have him.}
My mother she told me to pass him the sugar,
And he shivvelled and shovelled it down like a bugger.}

\verse{My mother she told me to take him to bed,
\textit{Ay, but I'll not have him.}

And the daft old devil nigh stood on his head.}

\textit{Ay, but I'll not have him.}
My mother told me to show him what to do,
But the silly old cod couldn't learn how to screw.}

\textit{Ay, but I'll not have him.}
My mother she told me to bid him farewell,
Well I bid him farewell and I wished him in hell.}

\textit{Ay, but I'll not have him.}
There was an old man came over the sea,
Came snivelling, snuffling, over on me.}
