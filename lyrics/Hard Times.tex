\verse{Let us pause in life's pleasures and count the many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears:
Oh, hard times, come again no more.}

\chorus{It's a song, the sigh of the weary,
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door,
Oh, hard times, come again no more.}

\verse{While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
There are frail forms waiting at the door.
Though their voices are silent their pleading lips will say,
``Oh, hard times, come again no more."}

\verse{There's a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
With a worn heart, whose better days are o'er.
Though her voice would be merry, `tis sighing all the day,
Oh, hard times, come again no more.}

\verse{`Tis a sigh that is wafted across the troubled wave,
`Tis a wail that is heard upon the shore,
`Tis a dirge that is murmured across the lowly grave:
Oh, hard times, come again no more.}
