\verse{I wish I were on yonder hill,
`Tis there I'd sit and cry my fill,
And ev'ry tear would turn a mill.
Iss guh day thoo a voorneen slawn.}

\chorus{Shule, shule, shule aroon,
Shule go succir agus, shule go kewn;
Shule go dheen durrus oggus aylig lume,
Iss guh day thoo a voorneen slawn.}

\verse{I'll sell my rod, I'll sell my reel,
I'll sell my only spinning wheel,
To buy my love a sword of steel,
Iss guh day thoo a voorneen slawn.}

\verse{I'll dye my petticoats, I'll dye them red,
And through the streets I'll beg my bread,
Until my parents should wish me dead,
Iss guh day thoo a voorneen slawn.}

\verse{I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,
I wish I had my heart again,
And vainly think I'd not complain,
Iss guh day thoo a voorneen slawn.}

\verse{And now my love has gone to France,
To try his fortune to advance,
If he e'er comes back, `tis but a chance,
Iss guh day thoo a voorneen slawn.}

\verse{Come, come, come oh love,
Quickly come to me, softly move,
Come to the door and away we'll flee,
And safe forever may my darling be.}
