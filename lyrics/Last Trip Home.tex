\verse{A've aye worked on farms an frae the start,
The muckle horses won ma heart.
Wi' big strong backs they proudly stand,
The uncrowned kings o' a' the land.
And yet for a' their power and strength,
They're gentle as a summer's wind.}

\chorus{So steady, boys, walk on,
Oor work is nearly done.
No more we'll till or ploo the fields,
The horses' day is gone,
An' this will be oor last trip home,
So steady, boys, walk on.}

\verse{You'll hear men sing their songs of praise
Of Arab stallions in a race,
Or hunters wha' fly wi' the hounds
Tae chase the fox and run him down,
But nane o' them compares, I vow
Tae a workin' pair that pulls a plough.}

\verse{Well of a' the years I've plied my trade
And a' the fields we've ploo'd and laid,
I never thought I'd see the time
When a Clydesdale's work wid ever end.
But progress runs its driven course,
And tractors hae replaced the horse.}

\verse{As we head back, oor friends have lined
The road tae be there one last time,
For nane of them would want tae miss
The chance tae see us pass like this.
They'll say they saw in years tae come
The muckle horses' last trip home.}
