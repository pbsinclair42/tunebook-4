\verse{When these shoes were new it was ``How do you do'',
It was whisky and telling our tales,
And when my shirt was clean I was there to be seen,
I had clear eyes and my smile never failed.}

\chorus{All of my brothers I met on the way,
They were drinking by night,
They were drinking by day.
Ah restore to my eyes
What was clear and was bright,
Honey, take me out drinking tonight.
Honey, take me out drinking tonight.}

\verse{Bluebells and matches and stains on the table,
Ah the sweet smell of the luscious woodbine.
``Ah Mr McEwan you will be my ruin'',
I say, but I don’t really mind.}

\verse{I'm still smiling through, though there’s stains on my shoes.
The right is heavy and the left it is light.
If it's left up to you then I know what you'd do,
Honey, take me out drinking tonight.
Honey, take me out drinking tonight.}
