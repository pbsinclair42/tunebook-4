\verse{A process man am I, and I'm telling you no lie.
I work and breath among the fumes that trail across the sky.
There's thunder all around me and a poison in the air,
There's a lousy smell that smacks of Hell and dust all in my hair.}

\chorus{And it's go, boys, go! They'll time your every breath,
And every day you're in this place you're two days nearer death, but you go.}

\chorus{I've worked among the spinners and I've breathed the oily smoke,
I've shovelled up the gypsum and it nigh on made you choke.
I've stood knee deep in cyanide, got sick with a caustic burn,
Been working rough I've seen enough to make your stomach turn.}

\verse{There's overtime and bonus opportunity galore;
The young lads like the money and they all come back for more.
But soon you're knocking on and you look older than you should,
For every bob made on this job you'll pay with flesh and blood.}
