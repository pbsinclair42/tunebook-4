\verse{The king has been a poor prisoner and a prisoner long in Spain
And Willie of the Winsbury has lain lang with his daughter at hame.}

\verse{``What ails ye, what ails ye, my daughter Janet? Ye look so pale and wan.
Oh have you had any sore sickness or yet been sleeping wi' a man?''}

\verse{``Oh was it with a lord or a duke or a knight or a man of birth and fame?''
``No, it was with Willie of Winsbury, I could bide no longer alane.''}

\verse{The king called on his merry men all by thirty and by three
``Go fetch me this Willie of Winsbury for hanged he shall be.''}

\verse{But when he came the king before, he was clad all in the red silk,     
His hair was like the strands of gold, his skin was as white as milk.}

If I were a woman as I am a man my bedfellow you would have been.''}

\verse{``And will you marry my daughter Janet by the truth of your right hand?
Oh if you marry my daughter Janet I'll make you the lord of my land.''}

\verse{``Oh yes I'll marry your daughter Janet by the truth of my right hand.
Yes I will marry your daughter Janet but I'll not be the lord of your land.''}

\verse{He's mounted her on a milk white steed and himself on a dapple grey.
He's made her the lady of as much land as they can ride in a long summer's day.}
