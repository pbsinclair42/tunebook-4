\chorus{Betsy Bell and Mary Gray,
They were twa bonny lasses;
They biggit thair bower on Burn Brae,
And theek't it ower wi' rashes.}

\verse{They theek't it ower wi' rashes green,
They theekit it ower wi' heather,
But the plague cam fae the burra toon
And slew them baith thegether.}

\verse{They widna hae thair shuin o reid,
They widna hae them yella,
Bit they wid hae thair shuin o green
Tae treid the pads thegether.}

\verse{Thair faither said til baith o them,
``Alane ye maun ey be,
For gin ye lat anither in,
Then ye will shairly dee."}

\verse{There wis a lad in burra toon
Wha Mary's luve would win,
He cam up til the lasses' door,
Bit they widna lat him in.}

\verse{``Ye maun be cauld," the laddie cried,
``For wuid for the fire ye lack,
I will gang til the mercat
And shuin I will be back."}

\verse{He brocht them baith a stack o wuid,
Sae winter they could dree,
Bit he left forbye his haundkerchief,
And on it wis a flea.}

\verse{They thocht tae lie in Methven kirkyaird
Amang thair geentle kin,
Bit they maun lie in Dronach haugh
Anent the roaring linn.}
