\verse{'Tis a damn tough life full of toil and strife we whalermen undergo,
And we won't give a damn when the gale is done how hard the winds did blow,
For we're homeward bound from the Arctic Ground on a good ship taught and free,
And we won't give a damn when we drink our rum with the girls of Old Maui.}

\chorus{Rolling down to Old Maui, me boys, rolling down to Old Maui,
We're homeward bound from the Arctic Ground, rolling down to Old Maui.}

\verse{Once more we sail with a Northerly gale through the ice and wind and rain.
Them coconut fronds, them tropical lands we soon shall see again.
For six hellish months we're bound away on the cold Kamchatka sea,
But now we're bound from the Arctic Ground, rolling down to Old Maui.}

\verse{Once more we sail with a Northerly gale towards our island home.
Our mainmast sprung, our whaling done, and we ain't got far to roam.
Our stans'ls bones is carried away, what care we for that sound?
A living gale is after us, thank god we're homeward bound.}

\verse{How soft the breeze through the island trees, now the ice is far astern.
Them native maids, them tropical glades is awaiting our return.
Even now their big, brown eyes look out, hoping some fine day to see
Our baggy sails running 'fore the gales, rolling down to Old Maui.}
