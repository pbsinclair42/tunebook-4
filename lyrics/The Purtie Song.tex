\chorus{Well, I've been peelin' purties, and you know I'm under thirty,
I started at sixteen to impress the country girls.
I was the best in county so she said that she would mount me.
I'll be married in the morning and the spuds I've to prepare.}

\verse{Well, I'd have warn a johnny if I'd have had one on me,
but the humour it came upon me faster than I thought.
Apologies I was making til I was overtaken,
Her father was between us and I had drawn my lot.}

\verse{I asked her if she'd thank me for the hanky panky,
She said that she would rank me at the bottom of her list.
I said that I'd be leaving, her father was disagreeing,
Now I'm living here in this matrimonial bliss.}

\verse{Come all you purtie peelers, turf diggers and free wheelers,
Men who live the bold life, and those who stay at home.
Now I'm getting older, the days are getting colder,
Come men younger and bolder, my story goes like this.}
