\verse{I once had a long long talk with a collier captain,
Strolling down by the old quayside.
His hold was filled with tobacco
That was smuggled up the Esk on the tide.}

\chorus{Give me a guinea for me brandy,
Make me a profit on the job.
Give me a guinea for me brandy, 
It's the King's excise men that I rob.}

\verse{Now the gang they had the old Ship Inn at Saltburny,
John Andrew he was the licensee.
A Scotsman come way down from the mountains,
Now he's making his fortune by the sea.}

\verse{Now beware the Mermaid and the Eagle,
The king has put those tall ships out to sea,
They'll run down, they'll wreck the Morgan Rattler,
And they'll send the figurehead to old Whitby.}

\verse{Now me salty lads of Cleveland you must listen:
Don't sail the same tide as Andrew's men.
Be a jet miner or a whaler,
Or the excise men will get you in the end.}
