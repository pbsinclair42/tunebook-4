\verse{I'll sing you the story o' Erchie Cathcairt,
A fella who aye took good care o' his hert.
An' I don’t mean in terms o' romance and its issues,
No Erchie took care tae avoid fatty tissues.}

\verse{He read books on stress and he read books on diet
And made sure his hert wis well nourished and quiet.
As soon as he found oot that fags were a threat
He said ``Erchie Cathcairt's smoked his last cigarette".}

\verse{And no just himsel' - he'd a smoke-free abode;
Fags were banned fae his flat in Victoria Road.
When his chain-smokin' pals said that wis too hard o' him,
He said ``You look efter yer ain pericardium".}

\verse{On Glesga's Soo' Side the air disnae come near
The EEC’s requirement for clean atmosphere,
So whenever he ventured ootside his ain close,
Cathcairt wore a mask ower his mooth and his nose.}

\verse{Cos joggin' wis good for reducing your weight away,
He'd jog everywhere even tae the Gateway
Where he bought low fat milk and high fibre breid:
Yon loaves that are covered in caraway seed.}

\verse{Then fresh fruit and veg, and when he had paid,
He'd jog away hame wi' a bag on each side.
When he read o' the good-herted Glesga campaign
He signed oan at wance wae nae sign o' delay'n'.}

\verse{About his blood pressure he hadnae a qualm,
And his weight matched his height tae the last milligram.
But his doctor consulting a chart on the wall
Says ``You’re two points too high in your cholesterol.".}

\verse{``But there's nae need tae worry, just cut oot dessert".
``Ah never eat pudding", says Erchie Cathcairt.
He jogged away hame in the depth o' despair
Efter ten years o' Muesli whit could he dae mair?}

\verse{Then he read in the papers some scientist say
How yer hert can be helped wi' twa aspirins a day.
And the very next mornin' the Herald declare't
Drinkin' wine wi' yer meal must be good for yer hert.}

\verse{``Eureka!" cried Erchie, ``the method tae beat `em all
Is a wee gless o' Eldo and two paracetamol!".
But he thought (since his hale life he's aye been teetotal)
One gless widnae dae - so he drank the hale bottle.}

\verse{Then oan wae his Reeboks doonstairs he did flee
Right in front o' a bus: number 44B.
It knocked him six metres, a terrible sight,
But the autopsy showed his cholesterol wis right.}

\verse{It wis some consolation tae his family physician
That he died wi' his hert in a perfect condition.}

\verse{They say that small troubles are sent here to try ye,
They tell ye whit's fur ye will never go by ye.
If yer name's on the bullet ye willnae be spairt,
He wis hit by a bus that wis bound for Cathcairt.}
