\verse{My dainty lass, lay you the blame
Upon the richtfu' heid;
'Twas daft ill-luck that bigg'd yer hame
The wrang side o' the Tweed.
Ye hae yer tocher a' complete,
Ye're bonny as the rose,
But I was born in Baltic Street,
In Baltic Street, Montrose.}

\verse{Lang syne on mony a waefu' nicht,
Hie owre the sea's distress,
I've seen the great airms o' the licht
Swing oot frae Scurdyness;
An' prood, in sunny simmer blinks,
When land-winds rase an' fell,
I'd flee my draigon on the links
Wi' callants like mysel'.}

\verse{Oh, Baltic Street is cauld an' bare
An' mebbe no sae grand,
But yeâ€™ll feel the smell i' the caller air
O' kippers on the land.
'Twixt kirk an' street the deid fowk bide,
Their feet towards the sea,
Ill neebours for a new-made bride,
Gin ye come hame wi' me.}

\verse{The steeple shades the kirkyaird grass,
The seamen's hidden banes,
A dour-like kirk to an English lass
Wha kens but English lanes;
And when the haar, the winter through,
Creeps blind on close and wa'
My hame micht get a curse frae you,
Mysel' get mebbe twa.}

\verse{I'll up an' aff the morn's morn
To seek some reid-haired queyn,
Bauld-he'rted, strang-nieved, bred an' born
In this auld toon o' mine.
And oh! for mair I winna greet,
Gin we hae meal an' brose,
And a but an' ben in Baltic Street,
In Baltic Street, Montrose.}
