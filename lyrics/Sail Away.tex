\verse{In the foggy morning,
When the dew is on the grass,
And the blackbird's singing,
And the spring's come at last,}

\chorus{I'll sail away, I'll sail away,
I'll sail away, I'll sail away, sail away.}

\verse{Tell my mother and father
That I'm bound away to sea,
Where the salt wind's at my shoulder,
And there's no-one to bother me.}

\verse{I'll get up bright and early,
Throw on my pack and go.
Tell all the folk who knew me
That I'm away and bound to rove.}

\verse{There's a vessel waiting
Down by the silver shore,
And on it soon I'll be a-hasting
Where fears can't trouble me no more.}

\verse{Leave my sorrows behind me
Upon the fast-receding sand,
And let me revel in the wild wind's glee,
And freedoms seldom found on land.}

\verse{Let the waves quell my anger,
Drown all my bitterness and shame,
Smooth my rougher edges over;
Though I may never quite be tame.}

\verse{Let those sea monsters rage below,
In their home, the briny deep,
While far above the ocean rocks me slow,
And in her arms I'll safely sleep.}
