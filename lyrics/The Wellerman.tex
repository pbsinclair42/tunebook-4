\verse{There once was a ship that put to sea
And the name of the ship was the Billy of Tea.
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down,
Blow, me bully boys, blow}

\chorus{Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum.
One day, when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and go.}

\verse{She had not been two weeks from shore
When down on her a right whale bore.
The captain called all hands and swore
He'd take that whale in tow.}

\verse{Before the boat had hit the water
The whale's tail came up and caught her.
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
As she dived down below.}

\verse{No line was cut, no whale was freed,
The captain's mind was not on greed,
For he belonged to the whaleman's creed;
She took that ship in tow.}

\verse{For forty days or even more
The line went slack then tight once more.
All boats were lost, there were only four,
But still that whale did go.}

\verse{As far as I've heard, the fight's still on,
The line's not cut and the whale's not gone,
The Wellerman makes his regular call
To encourage the captain, crew and all.}
