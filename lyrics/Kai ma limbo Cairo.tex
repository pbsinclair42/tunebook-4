\verse{High up in the old ash tree,
\textit{Far along the bonnie, bonnie brig,}
Two are hid where none can see,
\textit{Kai ma limbo Cairo!}
And from there they'll not come down,
\textit{Far along the bonnie, bonnie brig,}
Till the world in blood is drowned,
\textit{Kai ma limbo Cairo!}}

\chorus{And the price is set but you dare not pay
For it far exceeds a ducat for a day.
All because they heard you say:
``Kai, ma limbo, Cairo!"}

\verse{First a wolf will catch the moon,
\textit{Far along the bonnie, bonnie brig,}
Then will darkness fall at noon,
\textit{Kai ma limbo Cairo!}
Then a wolf will eat the sun,
\textit{Far along the bonnie, bonnie brig,}
And the battle is begun,
\textit{Kai ma limbo Cairo!}}

\verse{Did you see the dead pass by?
\textit{Far along the bonnie, bonnie brig,}
Each with vengeance in his eye,
\textit{Kai ma limbo Cairo!}
Did you see the ship set sail?
\textit{Far along the bonnie, bonnie brig,}
Made of dead men's fingernails,
\textit{Kai ma limbo Cairo!}}

\verse{High above a stallion rides,
\textit{Far along the bonnie, bonnie brig,}
With four legs on either side,
\textit{Kai ma limbo Cairo!}
On his back, a one-eyed man,
\textit{Far along the bonnie, bonnie brig,}
He will kill them if he can,
\textit{Kai ma limbo Cairo!}}

\verse{There's a serpent girded â€˜round,
\textit{Far along the bonnie, bonnie brig,}
He will shake the mountains down,
\textit{Kai ma limbo Cairo!}
When the mighty beast uncoils,
\textit{Far along the bonnie, bonnie brig,}
Stars will fall and seas will boil,
\textit{Kai ma limbo Cairo!}}

\verse{High up in the Old Ash Tree,
\textit{Far along the bonnie, bonnie brig,}
Two are hid where none can see,
\textit{Kai ma limbo Cairo!}
And from there they'll not come down,
\textit{Far along the bonnie, bonnie brig,}
Till the world in blood is drowned,
\textit{Kai ma limbo Cairo!}}
